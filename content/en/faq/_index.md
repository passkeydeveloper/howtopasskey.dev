        FIDO credentials are cryptographic keys stored on end-user devices (computers, phones, security keys, etc.) that are used for secure user authentication. When a FIDO credential automatically syncs from the device that it was originally created on (typically a phone or computer) to another of the user’s devices, it is called a <i>"multi-device credential"</i>. This is in contrast to a <i>"single-device credential"</i> which is available only on a single device, and cannot be backed up and restored this way.

        When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website, the device’s operating system requests to approve the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user uses to unlock the device. The app or website can use this mechanism instead of the traditional username and password.

        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
